## Add proguard rule (optional)
When building an Android App with minify enabled, some rules must be added to proguard-rules.pro in order to make the SeeSo SDK work properly.

Insert below code into app module's [`proguard-rules.pro`](app/proguard-rules.pro).
```
-keep class camp.visual.libgaze.callbacks.JNICallbackDispatcher {
  *;
}
